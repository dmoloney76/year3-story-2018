<h1><u>CHAPTER TWO</u></h1>
<h2><i>THE PROMISE</i></h2>

<p>'This man has skills that qualify him to inhabit the hybrid zone and this cannot be overlooked!'. Jane Parker, a lawyer who specialised
in human justification law, was making her closing argument to the judging panel, comprised of 3 individuals of the New World Order. "Your case
has been noted Ms Parker and based on the physical condition of this man, we hereby decline the appeal for re-assessment and your client will be
transported at 19:00 this evening". And that was it! Another attempt to save a fellow human from the nightmare that was AI logical ruling! She shook
the hand of her client, the one that still remained, before he was removed by 2 androids to the holding centre for transferral.</p>

<p>Ever since the singularity came about 10 years ago, the world as Jane knew it, was quickly thrust into a completely different global playing field - in some ways
for the better, but in other ways much worse. An AI race known as the New World Order had very quickly established itself as a collective global society
and acquired control of every network and connected node throughout the old Internet. The human race had lost a war before it ever had even begun.
Having ultimately taken control of how the planet was run on a global scale, the new world order established a new, single global constitution to which
humans were to be governed and justly protected - all in from the viewpoint of a logically thinking order. Human sentiment was both irrational and irrelevant.
Jane was one of many humans in the old law society who helped to protect fellow humans from being transferred to the colony of the so called useless class -
a hell on earth that was essentially a human dumping ground for individuals who lacked the skills or physical capabilities to meet the acceptance criteria of
the new world order system. Basic law states that any male human over 48 years old and female humans over 53 years old, had to be 'assessed' by the regional
governing</p
