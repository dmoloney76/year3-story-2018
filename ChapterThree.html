<h1><u>CHAPTER THREE</u></h1>
<h2><i>THE SEARCH</i></h2>

<p>All gauges in the aircraft were reading correctly as they approached the coast of Hell's Island, the final destination for
humans who were deemed to have nothing left to offer. It symbolised the whole demise of the human race and their struggles to cope
with the New World Order. Many people who were still inhabiting the hybrid zone attempted to establish "safe havens" in remote locations
as a proactive attempt to avoid their inevitable transfer to a colony that held nothing but pain and sorrow. But these attempts to try and secure
a happy ending were both difficult and dangerous - even in this new age, black markets still operated and thrived on human desperations.</p>
<p>The crew of the aircraft were making their weekly run to the colony to transfer the latest additions to the islands inhabitants. They were also
tasked with searching for names on a list provided by the New World Order high council. This list was compiled based on successful appeals against past
transfers. Most weeks, no list was dispatched to the crew upon departure. This week, there was a list and it contained a single name - one Mr. Frank
Parker. The record was electronically authorised by the high council based on the successful appeal submitted by councillor Jane Parker. The crew did not
normally carry civilian passengers who were not being transferred but, in this case, an exception was granted in the case of Jane Parker - she was going to
be reunited with her father! Ironically, she was making a trip to the colony and it was the happiest she had been in a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Frank Parker prepared to make the weekly journey to the nearest AI outpost on the island. He tried to remain hopeful that this would be the day that he
would hear his name announced on the loudspeaker as having been successful for repatriation to the Hybrid zone. He found himself struggling to find the energy
and the will to make these journeys nowadays but he had made a promise and a promise he would keep. When he heard his name and number boom out over the speakers
in the presence of hundreds of desolate misfortunes, his beaming smile was quickly followed but uncontrollable sobbing of sorrow and joy. He was going to see
his daughter again!</p>
