<h1><u>CHAPTER THREE</u></h1>
<h2><i>THE SEARCH</i></h2>

<p>All gauges in the aircraft were reading correctly as they approached the coast of Hell's Island, the final destination for
humans who were deemed to have nothing left to offer. It symbolised the whole demise of the human race and their struggles to cope
with the New World Order. Many people who were still inhabiting the hybrid zone attempted to establish "safe havens" in remote locations
as a proactive attempt to avoid their inevitable transfer to a colony that held nothing but pain and sorrow. But these attempts to try and secure
a happy ending were both difficult and dangerous - even in this new age, black markets still operated and thrived on human desperations.</p>
<p>The crew of the aircraft were making their weekly run to the colony to transfer the latest additions to the islands inhabitants. They were also
tasked with searching for names on a list provided by the New World Order high council. This list was compiled based on succesful appeals against past
transfers. Most weeks, no list was dispatched to the crew upon departure. This week, there was a list and it contained a single name - one Mr. Frank
Parker. The record was electronically authorised by the high council based on the succesful appeal submitted by councilor Jane Parker. The crew did not
normally carry civilian passengers who were not being transferred but in this case, an exception was granted in the case of Jane Parker - whe was going to
be reunited with her father!</p>
