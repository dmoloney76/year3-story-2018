<h1><u>CHAPTER THREE</u></h1>
<h2><i>THE SEARCH</i></h2>

<p>All gauges in the aircraft were reading correctly as they approached the coast of Hell's Island, the final destination for
humans who were deemed to have nothing left to offer. It symbolised the whole demise of the human race and their struggles to cope
with the New World Order. Many people who were still inhabiting the hybrid zone attempted to establish "safe havens" in remote locations
as a proactive attempt to avoid their inevitable transfer to a colony that held nothing but pain and sorrow. But these attempts to try and secure
a happy ending were both difficult and dangerous - even in this new age, black markets still operated and thrived on human desperations.</p>
<p>The crew of the aircraft were making their weekly run to the colony to transfer the latest additions to the islands inhabitants. They were also
tasked with searching for names on a list provided by the New World Order high council. This list was compiled based on successful appeals against past
transfers. Most weeks, no list was dispatched to the crew upon departure. This week, there was a list and it contained a single name - one Mr. Frank
Parker. The record was electronically authorised by the high council based on the successful appeal submitted by councillor Jane Parker. The crew did not
normally carry civilian passengers who were not being transferred but, in this case, an exception was granted in the case of Jane Parker - she was going to
be reunited with her father! Ironically, she was making a trip to the colony and it was the happiest she had been in a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Frank Parker never awoke the morning he planned to make the weekly journey to the nearest AI outpost on the island. His heart had stopped beating at some
point during the cold night as he lay in his 8x8 foot cabin which were known by the island inhabitants as 'coffins above the ground'. He dreamt the same dream
he usually experienced in slumber - he was 35 years old again and he was bringing his new-born baby daughter home from hospital on a beautiful May afternoon. His
heart swelled with pride and joy as he welcomed his first child into the world and was preparing for his first steps in parenthood. He held her lovingly and
whispered to her how he would always be there for her and would never let any harm come her way. The day Jane Parker was born was arguably the happiest day of
his life.</p>
<p>'Approved for repatriation - Frank Parker, number Y36DK338182'. The name and number boomed out over the speakers in the presence of hundreds of desolate
misfortunes. Frank Parker never got to feel the joy of hearing this sound and the fulfilment of a promise that he never gave up on.</p>
<p>The androids would be dispatched to locate his body on the assumption that he was either deceased or injured - both were logical assumptions!</p>
