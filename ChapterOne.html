<h1><u>CHAPTER ONE</u></h1>
<h2><i>HOPE</i></h2>

<p>It was just turning twilight when Frank started the ritual of getting ready for the oncoming
onslaught that was night-time and the horrors that it would bring. God knows when he last had a
peaceful night's sleep, when he last had a slumber so soothing that his body felt utterly energised,
replenished and willing to face the day.</p><p>'To face the day'! That was a saying
from the old world that meant something good and honest, something decent folk were happy to
do in order to feel alive and feel human. To face the day and contribute to the workforce, to society,
to the local community and humanity in general and feel that it gave some meaning to their existence.
Frank had often pondered the meaning of life during a time when life meant something completely different,
something precious and sacred. These days, life was as cheap and inexpensive as the old cocktail sticks he used to stock to serve his
favourite starter dish at dinner parties he'd host for friends</p><p> 'Christ, what am I doing here?', he
thought, 'what am I hanging on for anymore?'. This question was constant! The human condition of self
preservation! Was it a gift or a curse? In a world that was crumbling and lifeless, it always felt like the latter.
But he had to keep going! He had to continue fighting and scrapping, continue to push through the hunger, the fear
and sadness that weighed upon so heavily that most days he felt he was going to drop and never be able to rise once
more. But he couldn't give up, lie down and die and become another forgotten number in the colony of the useless class! He had to
believe that he wouldn't be simply forgotten about and that somehow he would be returned to the people that he loved and an existence
that he craved.</p>
<p>Hope! It was hope that kept him sane and it was hope that was pushing him closer to breaking point. 'Move Frank',
he muttered to himself, 'just move your feet and get back before night falls!'</p>
