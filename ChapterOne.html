<h1><u>CHAPTER ONE</u></h1>
<h2><i>HOPE</i></h2>

<p>It was just turning twilight when Frank started the ritual of getting ready for the oncoming
onslaught that was night-time and the horrors that it would bring. God knows when he last had a
peaceful night's sleep, when he last had a slumber so soothing that his body felt utterly energised,
replenished and willing to face the day.</P><p>'To face the day'! That was a saying
from the old world that meant something good and honest, something decent folk were happy to
do in order to feel alive and feel human. To face the day and contribute to the workforce, to society,
to the local community and humanity in general and feel that it gave some meaning to their existence.
Frank had often pondered the meaning of life during a time when life meant something completely different,
something precious and sacred. These days, life was as cheap and inexpensive as the old cocktail sticks he used to stock to serve his
favourite starter dish at dinner parties he'd host for friends</p>
